== Risks and Technical Debts

The technical risks and technical debts section of the document provides an overview of potential challenges and issues
that may arise during the development and maintenance of the project. These risks and debts need to be carefully considered
and addressed to ensure the successful completion and long-term viability of the project. The following subsections outline the
internal and external technical risks, as well as the technical debts that should be taken into account.

=== Technical risks

We consider a technical risk a potential event that can threaten the successful completion of the project, delay timelines, increase costs, or even lead to project failure if not properly managed.
The following subsections outline the internal and external technical risks that have been identified for the project.

==== Internal

[options="header",cols="1,3,3"] 
|===
| Description | Priority |  Considerations

| Poor knowledge of base project and tools used
| 8
| This factor will clearly constraint the development as it creates a new set of research tasks to be accomplished by each team member, but given the deadline and the consequences of starting greenfield, it seems like the most reasonable option

| Limited expertise in emerging technologies
| 7
| Ignorance of emerging technologies relevant to the project might result in missed opportunities for innovation and efficiency. Regular training sessions or workshops should be considered to keep the team updated on the latest industry trends.

| Use of ARM64 machine
| 6
| The use of an ARM64 machine for development and deployment may introduce compatibility issues with certain software libraries and tools that are primarily designed for x86 architecture. This could result in additional effort and time required to ensure compatibility and may limit the availability of certain features or optimizations. Thorough testing and evaluation of software dependencies on ARM64 architecture is necessary to mitigate potential risks.

| Incomplete infrastructure planning
| 5
| A lack of comprehensive planning for the project's infrastructure can result in delayed implementation and increased costs. Ensuring a detailed infrastructure plan is in place, including hardware and software requirements, is vital for a smooth project start.

| Unequal distribution of efforts across the team
| 4
| If team members are not assigned tasks and responsibilities properly, it can lead to an uneven distribution of efforts. This can result in delays, bottlenecks, and decreased productivity. Regular monitoring and effective communication are essential to ensure a balanced workload and maximize team efficiency.

==== External

[options="header",cols="1,3,3"]
|===
| Description | Priority |  Considerations

| Oracle Cloud Failure
| 8
| The project relies on Oracle Cloud services for hosting and deployment. Any failure or downtime of Oracle Cloud services could result in service interruptions, data loss, and a poor user experience. This impact is only reduced thanks to the ease of migration of our dockerized services.

| Wikidata API failure
| 3
| Even though an API failure is possible, it's a low impact event because we have the questions stored in the database and the game would still work.

=== Technical debts

[options="header",cols="1,3,3"]

| Description | Priority | Considerations

| Lack of actual scalability
| 8
| While the project's microservices architecture is designed to be scalable, the current implementation may not be able to handle a significant increase in traffic. This could result in performance issues, downtime, and a poor user experience. Regular load testing and performance monitoring are essential to identify scalability issues and address them before they become critical.

This is mainly because load balancing and auto-scaling are not implemented yet.

| Code quality issues
| 5
| The project's codebase may contain quality issues such as code smells, duplication, and poor code documentation. This can make the codebase difficult to maintain, extend, and debug. Regular code reviews, refactoring, and documentation updates are essential to ensure the project's code quality and maintainability.

| Inadequate security measures
| 4
| The project's security measures may not be sufficient to protect against common threats such as, cross-site scripting, and DDoS attacks. Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that the project's security measures are up-to-date.

| Make the entire web internationalized
| 6
|The questions are not internationalized, so you can only play in english

| Optional requirements
| 8
| Not all optional requirements are implemented
