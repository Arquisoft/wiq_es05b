== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

WIQ (Wikidata Infinite Quest) is a project forked from the University of Oviedo latest base repo offered by the Software Architecture course. The development team (es05b) is formed by the following engineering students:

* Donato Martín, UO288787@uniovi.es
* Luna Valdés, UO289321@uniovi.es
* Álvaro García, UO289295@uniovi.es
* Rubén Rubio, UO276255@uniovi.es
* David Álvarez, UO288705@uniovi.es

This is basically a Trivial Pursuit like game inspired in spanish TV show "Saber y Ganar" aimed to develop its users' general knowledge as well as increasing their reflects, analytical thinking and also their focus. This will be achieved with all the main app functionality that includes:

* Scoring systems based on response times
* Different question categories
* A history of past games

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

****

Users will be able to interact with our system in a lot of different ways.

* A fun Q&A game
* A user registration system
* An API to obtain user information respecting the privacy terms accorded
* An API to obtain generated questions using real time updated and truthful information from the WikiData Programming Interface.

More information can be obtained following this https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pahOfYFY--Wi7_9bbxiKOGevB_9tOSyRm78blncgBKg[link], where the course project is fully described and detailed.

=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_iso_25010_topics.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****

The following table describes the project's quality goals in a descending order.

|=== 
| Quality Goal | Motivation

| *_Usability_*
| The application must be not only easy to learn and use but also fun because if a game has no joy in it, then it shall never be called for that name.

| *_Maintainability_*
| Projects should always have enough quality to be able to be modified without making more changes than necessary. Not following this principle would make an information system fail in the long run.

| *_Security_*
| Security is always key and therefore effort will be put into defending against unauthorised access of information, including the users' personal or sensitive data that the information system may contain.

| *_Scalability_*
| The application may or may not increase its demand given enough time so not pursuing this goal might lead to an unavoidable failure.

| *_Testability_*
| The performance of the system is needed to be tested covering as many use cases as possible so all the other goals will be met.

| *_Accessibility_*
| The project should be accesible and fun for all types of user, a game must always be as open as the development capabilities allow.

|=== 

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
