== 12. Testing report

=== 12.1. Unit tests
Every component is equipped with its own unit tests to ensure its functionality operates accurately, thereby enhancing the project's security and resilience.

=== 12.1.1. Coverage result
We employ the Sonar tool to validate that our code is thoroughly tested.
If the coverage falls below 80% or if there's more than 3% duplication, it triggers an error, halting integration until the minimum coverage is met.

=== 12.2. E2E tests
An end-to-end (E2E) test checks the entire application's functionality from start to finish,
simulating real user interactions to ensure it works as expected.
Our end-to-end approach focused on this functionality:
- Check game integrity
- Menu categories
- Answering a game question
- Game result
- Login / register

=== 12.4. Usability tests

In today's digital age, web usability plays a crucial role in ensuring a positive user experience. A website that is intuitive, easy to navigate, and responsive not only attracts users but also keeps them engaged and satisfied. Recognizing this importance, our team prioritized usability testing to ensure our website meets the needs and expectations of our target audience.
To conduct comprehensive testing, we divided our participants into two distinct groups. The first group consisted of individuals with prior experience using computers and navigating websites. Their insights and feedback helped us assess the effectiveness of our interface design and navigation structure for users familiar with digital platforms.
In contrast, the second group consisted of individuals with limited or no experience using computers. By including these participants, we aimed to identify any usability barriers or challenges that might difficult their interaction with our website. Their feedback provided valuable insights into areas where we could improve accessibility for individuals with varying levels of digital knowledge.
By testing our website with these diverse groups, we gained a comprehensive understanding of its usability across different users. This approach not only ensures inclusivity but also enhances the overall user experience, ultimately contributing to the success of our website in meeting its objectives.
