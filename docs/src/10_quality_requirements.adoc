== Quality Requirements

The required quality goals are:

- Privacy: Sensitive user information must be kept private at all times to prevent any third party from accessing it without consent.
- Usability: The application must be intuitive to use, with a clear design and without distractions.
This will facilitate the use of the application by any user without any effort.
- Perfomance: Performance is critical in the application, especially in the game itself.
This is intended to save the user long waiting times between questions, providing a fast and fluid experience.
- Maintainability and Escalability:  The application must be well structured so that functionalities
can be added or modified at any time in a simple and intuitive way, which will facilitate the work of the developers.

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Scenarios

==== Usage scenarios

===== Privacy
|===
|Usage Scenario |System Response

|The user reaches the landing page, enters the login screen and logs in.
|The system checks that the user's information is correct, if it is, it takes them
to the main page of the game, if not, it returns them to the login screen and
informs them of the error.
|===

===== Perfomance

|===
| Usage Scenario | System Response

|On the main page the user can view the different game modes, of which they must choose one
|When a game mode is chosen, the system will choose various questions to ask
the user, obtain all the information corresponding to the answers and show them
to the user.
|===

===== Usability

|===
| Usage Scenario | System Response

|A new user starts using the application, given the design of the page, they
quickly know what they have to do to register and how they have to use the application.
|Since the app has been designed with usability in mind, it will be very easy to use for new users.

|
|===
==== Change scenarios

===== Maintainability and Escalability

|===
| Change Scenario | System Response

|Add new game mode
|When new game modes are added, the previous ones should not be modified or
influenced by the new changes. All previous functionality should still be usable.

|Add alternative forms of login / signup 
|When new login / signup forms of login are added (e.g. with Google accounts),
the previous ones should still be valid and work properly.

|Implement hotfixes
|When critical errors are found, they must be corrected and applied on the go,
in a transparent way to the user and avoiding having to shut down the service for a long period of time.
