== Architecture Constraints


=== 1. Technical Constraints

These constraints are set by the project, and we believe that altering them would be counterproductive.
Therefore, we have chosen to adhere to them

=== 1. Technical Constraints

|===
| Constraint | Explanation

|*_Docker_*
| The app will be running in a Docker Host due to
its outstanding interoperability, robust security mechanisms, and its effectiveness in deploying applications

|*_Wikidata_*
| This project will be using wikidata to retrieve the source of the game questions

|*_React_*
| A JavaScript framework used for constructing visual interfaces.

|*_Git/GitHub_*
| Our development process will leverage Git for version control and GitHub as a remote repository. This combination empowers us to:
collaborate effectively, maintain a clean codebase and assign tasks

=== 2. Organizational Constraints

|===
| Constraint | Explanation

|*_Team_*
| Our team consists of five members who are new to collaborating with each other.

|*_Time_*
| Deadline at the end of the semester,
the time is divided among two hours per week of in-class work, multiple meetings with team members, and individual self-work.
Additionally, we will have three deliverables throughout the course, with weekly feedback from the instructor.

|*_Testing_*
| Various scenarios will be explored to assess the application's functionality accurately. Diverse testing techniques
will be employed to achieve comprehensive coverage, aiming for the highest possible quality assurance.

|*_Tech proficiency_*
|All team members are beginners in the majority of the technologies we're using, and this is our first endeavor
in developing a real-world application.

=== 3. Convention Constraints

|===
| Constraint | Explanation

|*_Clean Code_*
|The code composing the application must prioritize clarity and cleanliness, facilitating comprehension and ease of
maintenance in the long term

|*_Arc42_*
|The project utilizes https://arc42.org/[Arc42] for documentation purposes.

|*_Accessibility_*
|The application should be designed for easy navigation by any user, ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities.

|*_Usability_*
|We need to adhere to the conventions of the programming languages we're using, including https://jsdoc.app/[JavaScript]
