== Architecture Constraints


=== 1. Technical Constraints
[options="header",cols="2,7"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

****

These constraints are set by the project, and we believe that altering them would be counterproductive.
Therefore, we have chosen to adhere to them

|===
| Constraint | Explanation

|*_Docker_*
| The app will be running in a Docker Host
due to interoperability, security, and ease of deployment.
|*_WikiData_*
|This project will be using wikidata to retrieve the source of the game questions.
|*_React_*
| A JavaScript framework used for constructing visual interfaces.
|*_Git/GitHub_*
| Our development process will leverage Git for version control and GitHub as a remote repository. This combination empowers us to:
collaborate effectively, maintain a clean codebase and assign tasks

=== 2. Organizational Constraints

|===
| Constraint | Explanation

|*_Team_*
| Our team consists of five members who are new to collaborating with each other.

|*_Time_*
| Deadline at the end of the semester,
the time is divided among two hours per week of in-class work, multiple meetings with team members, and individual self-work.

|*_Testing_*
| Various scenarios will be explored to assess the application's functionality accurately. Diverse testing techniques
will be employed to achieve comprehensive coverage, aiming for the highest possible quality assurance.

|*_Tech proficiency_*
|All team members are beginners in the majority of the technologies we're using, and this is our first endeavor
in developing a real-world application.

| Constraint | Explanation

|*_Clean Code_*
|The code composing the application must prioritize clarity and cleanliness, facilitating comprehension and ease of
maintenance in the long term

|*_Arc42_*
|The project utilizes https://arc42.org/[Arc42] for documentation purposes.

|*_Accessibility_*
|The application should be designed for easy navigation by any user, ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities.

|*_Usability_*
|We need to adhere to the conventions of the programming languages we're using, including https://jsdoc.app/[JavaScript]
, https://html.spec.whatwg.org/[HTML] and https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/[CSS].
