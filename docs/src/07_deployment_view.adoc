== Deployment View

The infrastructure of our system consists mainly of a single server, which is hosted in a B1s Azure virtual machine. It contains a dockerized nodejs app based on microservices architecture which exposes port 3000 to the internet as an entry point to de user interface of the system. The server contains a MongoDB database used to store the application data and interacts with the Wikidata API in order to provide dynamic-generated content to the user based on the information retrieved.

Motivation::
The main reason for this infrastructure choice lies in the simplicity and flexibility of a dockerized microservice architecture solution, which allows a fast and straightforward deployment of the system in any environment.

Quality and/or Performance Features::
- Scalability: The system can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the same service with ease thanks to the container orchestrator.

- Portability: The app can be deployed in any environment that supports docker containers, which allows the system to be easily migrated to other cloud providers should it be necessary.

- Maintainability: The system can be updated (each container can be maintained/updated individually) by replacing the docker containers with new versions of the application, which allows the system to be maintained without remarkable issues.

- Security: The system is hosted in a secure environment (each container is a isolated enviroment, so in the case of a security breach, it only affects one of them) provided by the Azure cloud platform, which ensures its security and availability.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::

|===
| Component | Description

| User agent
| The client that will access the system through the web app.


| Azure B1s Virtual Machine
| Server in which the system is hosted.

| Docker
| Containerization platform used to deploy the system.

| Wikidata API
| External service used to retrieve dynamic content for the system.

=== Infrastructure Level 2

==== Docker component

The system is deployed in a dockerized enviroment in which each microservice is contained in a separate container. Docker compose is the selected orchestrator as it is a simple solution that meets the few deployment requirements necessary for a small system like ours. It allows the app to be easily deployed with different profiles by using a docker-compose file.
