== Deployment View

The infrastructure of our system consists mainly on a single server, which is hosted in
an Oracle Virtual Machine arm64 running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. It contains a dockerized
NodeJS app based on microservices architecture which exposes port 443 and 80 to
the internet as an entry point to the user interface of the system aswell as for the API.
The server contains a MongoDB database used to store the application data.
The system also interacts with the Wikidata API in order to provide
dynamic-generated content to the user based on the information retrieved.

Motivation:: The main reason for this infrastructure choice lies in the simplicity, flexibility, and platform agnosticism of a dockerized microservice architecture solution. This allows for a fast and straightforward deployment of the system in any environment, regardless of the underlying platform. This would allow an easy migration of the system to another cloud provider if necessary, as well as the ability to scale the system horizontally by adding more instances of the same service with ease thanks to the container orchestrator.

Quality and/or Performance Features::
- Scalability: The system can be easily scaled horizontally by adding more instances of the same service with ease thanks to the container orchestrator.

- Portability: The app can be deployed in any environment that supports docker containers, which allows the system to be easily migrated to other cloud providers should it be necessary.

- Maintainability: The system can be updated (each container can be maintained/updated individually) by replacing the docker containers with new versions of the application, which allows the system to be maintained without remarkable issues.

- Security: The system is hosted in a secure environment (each container is a isolated enviroment, so in the case of a security breach, it only affects one of them) provided by the Azure cloud platform, which ensures its security and availability.
